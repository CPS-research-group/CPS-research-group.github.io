DesCartes has several open positions in a wide variety of research topics. For a comprehensive list of current open positions please see [here](https://www.cnrsatcreate.cnrs.fr/descartes/){: .btn .btn--primary}.

There are two PhD student positions available under my supervision in the DesCartes program. Details about these two positions can be found below.

- [Physics-aware and multi-modal Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Data Detection and Reasoning with Probabilistic Guarantees](/_pages/assets/descartes/ood_phd.pdf){: .btn .btn--primary}

- [Distributed Optimal Control for Complex Systems](/_pages/assets/descartes/optimization_phd.pdf){: .btn .btn--primary}

If you are interested in any of these two PhD positions, please send an email along with a detailed CV to Arvind Easwaran (arvinde@ntu.edu.sg).
