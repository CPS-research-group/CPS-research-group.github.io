<p>We believe that the proposed 3-layered cyber infrastructure with cross-layer communication is the first approach that tightly couples resiliency with the self-awareness attribute of Industry 4.0. The physical layer comprises physical components such as sensors, actuators, controllers and communication hardware. The platform layer embodies computational and communicational platforms such as operating systems and network managers. The application layer accommodates the software components which describe the behavior of an application. E.g., product sorting on an assembly line.</p>
