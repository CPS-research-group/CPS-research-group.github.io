# Research Fellow (Postdoc): Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Data Detection and Reasoning

__Duration__: 3 years.

__Salary range__: Between S$5000 and S$7000 monthly depending on background and experience.

In this task we will explore the problem of achieving safety assurance for learning enabled components in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. A classic example is the object detection and classification component in an autonomous vehicle. We specifically focus on two research problems in this area: 1) Robust and predictable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data detection for Deep Neural Network (DNN) models with high-dimensional and multi-modal inputs. By detecting such OOD data efficiently at runtime, appropriate fail-safe operations can be performed when data outside of the training space are encountered. 2) Explore probabilistic black-box and grey-box verification techniques for the safety assurance of such OOD detection framework.

__Expected qualifications__:

  <ul>
    <li>PhD in Computer Science or related fields</li>
    <li>Research background and experience in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data detection and reasoning</li>
    <li>Desired: Research experience in probabilistic techniques for verification and validation of DNNs</li>
  </ul>

__Research environment__:

In this position, you are expected to manage a team of PhD students and research assistants, as well as collaborate with our research partners from other institutions. Opportunities for hands-on implementation experience in the form of simulation platforms and embedded test beds are also available. Opportunities for teaching can also be facilitated depending on interest.

If interested, please send an email along with a detailed CV to Arvind Easwaran (arvinde@ntu.edu.sg).
