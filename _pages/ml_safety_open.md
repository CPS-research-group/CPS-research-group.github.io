# Research Fellows (Postdocs)

__Duration__: 3 years.

__Salary range__: Between S$4500 and S$6000 monthly depending on background and experience.

__Expected qualifications__:

  <ul>
    <li>PhD in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related fields</li>
    <li> Research background and experience in the application of mathematical, particularly probabilistic, analysis techniques for reasoning about safety assurance in CPS</li>
    <li>Evidence of research publications in good venues</li>
  </ul>

__Number of positions__: 2

__Research topics__:

  <ol>
    <li><b>(Position 1)</b> High assurance techniques for efficient runtime detection of out-of-distribution images in vision based applications for CPS (training space characterization).</li>
    <li><b>(Position 2)</b> Probabilistic formal verification techniques for safety assurance of learning enabled components in CPS (e.g., data-driven techniques based on scenario optimization).</li>
  </ol>

__Research environment__:

In this position, you are expected to collaborate with and manage a team of PhD students and research assistants; the latter will support implementation activities in the project including a simulation platform (e.g., Carla) and an embedded testbed (e.g., Duckietown). Opportunities for teaching can also be facilitated depending on interest.

If interested, please send an email along with a detailed CV to Arvind Easwaran (arvinde@ntu.edu.sg).
