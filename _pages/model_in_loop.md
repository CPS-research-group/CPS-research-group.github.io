# Open Positions

These positions are part of a corporate lab initiative involving NTU and Delta Electronics, a leading electronics manufacturing company. The expected start date for the positions is January 2018, and the expected duration is 2.5 years. Remuneration will be attractive and commensurate based on the qualifications and suitability for the project. The positions are expected to provide an excellent opportunity to perform both fundamental as well as translational research in close collaboration with industry.

### 1. Research fellow (code generation)

We are seeking a strong and motivated candidate for the position of Research Fellow in the area of Cyber-Physical Systems, with research focus on automatic synthesis of code for embedded controllers and cyber-physical interfaces, as well as trace-driven root cause analysis. The candidate is expected to have a PhD degree in Computer Sciences, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or related fields. The candidate must demonstrate a strong research experience in one or more of the following areas:
<ol>
<li>Experience with code synthesis techniques for embedded devices, including I/O interfaces for cyber-physical and cyber-cyber interactions.</li>
<li>Techniques for trace-driven analysis of embedded code for root cause failure analysis.</li>
</ol>

The candidate will be responsible for the integration of developed cyber twin into the existing software tool chain used in smart manufacturing systems.

### 2. Research fellow (modelling)

We are seeking a strong and motivated candidate for the position of Research Fellow in the area of Cyber-Physical Systems, with research focus on the modelling, simulation and synthesis of continuous time and discrete time models. The candidate is expected to have a PhD degree in Computer Sciences, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or related fields. The candidate must demonstrate a strong research experience in one or more of the following areas:

<ol>
<li>Modelling and simulating hybrid systems based on mathematical model such as Hybrid Automata, ODEs, Timed Automata, Simulink Stateflow etc.</li>
<li>Background in developing formal semantics to capture interactions in a complex CPS model.</li>
<li>Understanding the nuances in discretising continuous timed models. E.g., zero-crossing error after discretising hybrid automata into a FSM.</li>
<li>Ability to translate mathematical models to C-code while preserving semantics is desired.</li>
</ol>

Besides technical contributions in the development of the cyber twin, the candidate will also be responsible for the management of the overall project. 

### 3. Research assistant (tool design and development)

We are seeking a strong and motivated candidate for the position of Project Officer in the area of Cyber-Physical Systems, with research focus on the modelling, simulation and synthesis of continuous time and discrete time models. The candidate is expected to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Sciences and Computer Engineering, or related fields. The candidate must demonstrate strong experience in one or more of the following areas:

<ol>
<li>Development of new IDEs for specification and simulation of mathematical models used for CPS.</li>
<li>Exposure to Simulink, LabView or similar IDEs for developing embedded code.</li>
<li>Understanding of frameworks used to develop tools such as Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.</li>
</ol>


### 4. Research assistant (code generation)

We are seeking a strong and motivated candidate for the position of Project Officer in the area of Cyber-Physical Systems, with research focus on code generation and deployment of distributed CPS. The candidate is expected to have a Bachelors degree in Computer Sciences and Computer Engineering, or related fields. The candidate must demonstrate strong experience in one or more of the following areas:

<ol>
<li>Proven experience in developing code for real-time embedded systems.</li>
<li>Exposure to Simulink, LabView or similar IDEs for developing embedded code.</li>
<li>Understanding of translation tools such as compilers.</li>
</ol>

### 5. PhD Student Position in Model Abstraction Techniques for CPS (August 2018)

One of the key challenges in model-based design for CPS is managing the complexity of models that capture physical properties of the target system. Often such properties exhibit continuous and non-linear dynamics, making it difficult to apply scalable formal methods or design-space optimization techniques on these models. In this thesis, we will explore model abstraction techniques that reduce the complexity sufficiently so that formal techniques can be applied in a scalable manner. One of the key requirements is that these abstraction techniques should preserve the properties of interest in the abstract model.

This PhD position is part of a corporate lab project together with Delta Electronics in the area of Smart Manufacturing. It is therefore expected that the student will have access to realistic CPS case studies from this domain for evaluating the efficacy of the developed model abstraction techniques.
