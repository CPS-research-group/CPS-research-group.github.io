# Research Fellow (Postdoc): Safety Validation of Deep Reinforcement Learning based Models

__Duration__: 3 years.

__Salary range__: Between S$5000 and S$7000 monthly depending on background and experience.

Within the trustworthiness assurance research track in this project, we will be exploring black-box and grey-box techniques for assessing the safety, robustness and fairness properties in deep reinforcement learning (dRL) frameworks used in the agent training programs (ATPs). In particular, we are interested in scalable techniques with statistical guarantees, which can handle multi-stage interactions with the ATPs. For this purpose, we are looking for a post-doctoral candidate with the following job scope: Conduct research on a framework for black-box and grey-box testing, with statistical (Probably Approximately Correct - PAC - like) guarantees, of deep reinforcement learning (dRL) architectures. These RL architectures will be deployed as automated trainers for agent (human or autonomous) training programs in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, emergency response, etc. 

__Expected qualifications__:

  <ul>
    <li>PhD in Computer Science or related fields</li>
    <li>Research background and experience in the safety validation and/or verification of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based architectures</li>
    <li>Desired: Research experience in the validation and/or verification of Deep Reinforcement Learning (dRL) based architectures</li>
  </ul>

__Research environment__:

In this position, you are expected to manage a team of PhD students and research assistants, as well as collaborate with our research partners from other institutions. Opportunities for hands-on implementation experience in the form of simulation platforms and embedded test beds are also available. Opportunities for teaching can also be facilitated depending on interest.

If interested, please send an email along with a detailed CV to Arvind Easwaran (arvinde@ntu.edu.sg).
